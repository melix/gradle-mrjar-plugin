= Multi-release JAR Gradle plugin
CÃ©dric Champeau

This plugin adds support for building and testing multi-release jars with Gradle.
It leverages the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html[toolchain support] to compile, test and run your application on the appropriate target JVMs.

This plugin has been successfully tested on Gradle {tested-versions}.
Earlier releases are not supported.

NOTE: Before using multi-release jars, you should double check that they are the right solution for your problem. Multi-release jars are a good solution when you want to support different runtimes, all having the same set of dependencies. In general, this should be limited to cases where you want to provide a dedicated implementation of a specific class for a particular Java runtime version, without having to use reflection to load it dynamically. Other use cases should be taken with a grain of salt. See https://blog.gradle.org/mrjars

== Usage

.Applying the plugin
[role="multi-language-sample",subs="attributes+"]
```groovy
include::../../../../samples/basic/groovy/build.gradle[tag=plugin_use]
```

[role="multi-language-sample",subs="attributes+"]
```kotlin
include::../../../../samples/basic/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tag=plugin_use]
```

The plugin will expose an extension called `multiRelease` which can be used to configure a number of source sets:

.Declaring versions
[role="multi-language-sample",subs="attributes+"]
```groovy
include::../../../../samples/basic/groovy/build.gradle[tag=declaring_versions]
```

[role="multi-language-sample",subs="attributes+"]
```kotlin
include::../../../../samples/basic/kotlin/build.gradle.kts[tag=declaring_versions]
```

The first version of the list is the version of the main source set. The code above will then automatically:

- configure the main source set to use Java 8
- create an additional source set `src/main/java11` for Java 11 specific classes
- create an additional source set `src/test/java11` for Java 11 specific test classes

The main source set will be compiled using a _Java 8_ toolchain, while the _Java 11_ source set will be compiled using a _Java 11_ toolchain.
There are advantages of doing do:

- JDK specific APIs are only visible to the appropriate source sets
- each source set can use JDK specific language features
- no need to use `bootclasspath` tricks

== Organization of sources

The main source set, `src/main/java`, is always compiled first.
You can see it as the "shared" source sets, where all the common classes live.
All additional source sets created by this plugin will automatically "see" the classes of the main source set.

For example, the following layout is valid:

```
src
 |-- main
      |-- java
           |-- org/my/company/SharedClass.java
           |-- org/my/company/Substituted.java
      |-- java11
           |-- org/my/company/Substituted.java
```

The `Substituted` class requires `SharedClass` at compile time, but you don't have to duplicate the code: it will automatically be visible when Gradle will compile the Java 11 version.

== Testing

One of the challenges of multi-release jars is testing.
This plugin provides support for testing in a similar way it does for compilation:

- for each target language version, a `src/test/javaXXX` source set is created with the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jvm_test_suite_plugin.html#jvm_test_suite_plugin[JVM Test Plugin]
- each language specific source set can see the classes from the main source set
- each source set can provide tests which are specific to the language version it is testing
- each source set can provide test classes which override tests from the main test sources

For example, the following layout is permitted:

```
src
 |-- test
      |-- java
           |-- org/my/company/CommonTests.java
           |-- org/my/company/SubstitutedTests.java
      |-- java11
           |-- org/my/company/SubstitutedTests.java
           |-- org/my/company/VersionSpecificTests.java
```

When executing the task `java11Test`, the following test cases will be executed:

- `CommonTests` from the main tests
- `SubstitutedTests` from the `java11` source set
- `VersionSpecificTests` from the `java11` source set

== Running on different JDKs

Eventually, if you also apply the `application` plugin, this plugin will create additional `run` tasks preconfigured for each language level.

For example, you select target languages 8, 11 and 17, the plugin will:

- configure the `run` task to use Java 8
- configure a `java11Run` task to run with Java 11
- configure a `java17Run` task to run with Java 17

== Sharing test configurations

You can easily configure the test of all Java versions using the link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.testing.base.TestingExtension.html[TestingExtension]:

.Confifure tests of all Java versions
[role="multi-language-sample",subs="attributes+"]
```groovy
testing {
     suites {
          configureEach {
               useJUnitJupiter()
               dependencies {
                    implementation('org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter:4.6.1')
               }
          }
     }
}
```

[role="multi-language-sample",subs="attributes+"]
```kotlin
testing {
     suites {
          configureEach {
               if (this is JvmTestSuite) {
                    useJUnitJupiter()
                    dependencies {
                         implementation("org.mockito:mockito-junit-jupiter:4.6.1")
                    }
               }
          }
     }
}
```

== Version specific dependencies

You can have dependencies specific to a version of Java.
For example, for the `java11` source set, it is possible to add a dependency only used to compile the sources found in `src/test/java11`:

.A source set specific dependency
```groovy
testing {
     suites {
          java11Test {
               dependencies {
                    implementation("my:library:1.0)
               }
          }
     }
}
```

Or its equivalent without the `testing` extension:

```groovy
dependencies {
    java11TestImplementation("my:library:1.0")
}
```

WARNING: Source set specific dependencies on **production code** (tests are fine) are a strong indication that a multi-release jar is the wrong abstraction. By definition, a multi-release jar is a single deliverable targetting different platforms _at runtime_. Because you don't know what the runtime will be, it means that all downstream consumers will bring the transitive dependencies _even if they don't need them_. Therefore, if you have version specific dependencies, it's a better idea to use Gradle's variant-aware dependency management mechanism to provide different deliverables _per release_ (eg. `mylib-java8.jar` and `mylib-java11.jar`), because the consumers would only get the dependencies they care about.
